### App description
This is a really simple pet project that displays a list of news article from [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/).
The app is written in Kotlin and uses Jetpack Compose for UI. It follows MVVM Clean Architecture and uses Android architecture components.

### Set up: 

#### To make the app run:
1. Create a local.properties file in the root of the project.
2. Add a line `API_KEY="your_newsapi.org_key_here"`

#### This is a showcase app intended to for my own learning purposes and to demonstrate the usage of: 

- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose + Compose navigation
- MVVM Clean Architecture
- Android architecture components
- Modularization
- Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt
- Coroutines + Flows
- Retrofit
- Room
